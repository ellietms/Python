1)The results of input is always string , if you want the number you should put 
int or float (depends on what you want to achieve) before the input.
2) ( : ) is like ({} in JS)
3) you should have indention after you define your function
4) for using any module you just need to import it , if you want to import 
different package from one module you should use => from <module name> import <package nameS>
5)you can use help(module name) to understand the module
6)you can use dir(module name) to see which packages the module have
7)python always show the number results with float

8)for showing the results of a variable you can choose either of these 2 ways :
    print(f"....{variable which is defined before}....")
    print("......{variable}.......".format(name of the variables are defined before))

9)join in python:
    "symbol".join(array)

    JS : array.join("symbol")

10)ASCI :
    Capital characters : start from 065 (A) to 090 (Z)
    Small   characters : start from 097 (a) to 122 (z)

*difference between the capital and small characters are 32.
    Capital characters + 32 = small characters 
      
11) ASCI functions :
    ord("characters you want") ==> show the ASCI
    char("ASCI number") ==> show the characters


12)Slicing in python: 
    S(name of array)[start : end (it always should be one more than the result we want )  : steps]
    we can use minus as well , minus start counting from right to left

13)Type of the result of each module we call are objects
